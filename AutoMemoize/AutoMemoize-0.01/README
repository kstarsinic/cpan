This is B::Fathom, a readability grader for Perl code.  Typical usage
of Fathom is, e.g., `perl -MO=Fathom <somefile>'.  For further
documentation, type `perldoc B::Fathom'.

This module is a backend for the Perl compiler, and has been tested
only with versions of Perl >= 5.005.

I'm eager to improve this module by providing more comprehensive
readability metrics.  Suggestions, bug reports, and patches are welcome;
please send all comments to kstar@cpan.org.
